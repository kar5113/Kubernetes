#### Installing kubernetes with aws eksctl
  1. Install kubectl command line tool
    For linux:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/amazon-eks/1.34.2/2025-11-13/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
    chmod +x ./kubectl
    mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp ./kubectl $HOME/bin/kubectl && export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH 

  2. Install eksctl command line tool
    For linux:
    ```bash
    # for ARM systems, set ARCH to: `arm64`, `armv6` or `armv7`
    ARCH=amd64
    PLATFORM=$(uname -s)_$ARCH
    curl -sLO "https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz"
    # (Optional) Verify checksum
    curl -sL "https://github.com/eksctl-io/eksctl/releases/latest/download/eksctl_checksums.txt" | grep $PLATFORM | sha256sum --check
    tar -xzf eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz -C /tmp && rm eksctl_$PLATFORM.tar.gz

#### Kubernetes notes
- namespace:
    - used to create multiple virtual clusters within a single physical cluster
    - useful for separating environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or teams within an organization
    - resources within a namespace are isolated from those in other namespaces
    - default namespace is "default"
    - can create custom namespaces using YAML files or kubectl commands
- pod: 
    - smallest and simplest Kubernetes object
    - represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster
    - can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage
    - pods are ephemeral and can be created, destroyed, and recreated as needed
    - managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments or StatefulSets for scalability and availability   
- labels:
    - key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects (e.g., pods, services, deployments)
    - used for organizing, selecting, and filtering resources
    - facilitate grouping and managing resources based on specific criteria
    - can be used in conjunction with selectors to perform operations on a subset of resources
    - labels are flexible and can be added or modified at any time without affecting the underlying resources
- Annotations:
    - key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects
    - used to store non-identifying metadata that can be used by tools and libraries
    - typically used for configuration or operational information that is not relevant for selection or grouping
    - unlike labels, annotations are not used for selecting or filtering resources
    - can be added or modified at any time without affecting the underlying resources 
    - special characters are allowed in annotation keys and values, making them suitable for storing larger or more complex data   
## Annotations vs labels
| Feature        | Labels                                           | Annotations                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose        | Used for identifying and grouping resources      | Used for storing non-identifying metadata       |
| Selection      | Can be used with selectors to filter resources   | Not used for selection or filtering             |
| Metadata Type  | Key-value pairs                                  | Key-value pairs                                 | 
| Use Cases      | Organizing resources, managing deployments       | Storing configuration or operational information|
| Modification   | Can be added or modified at any time             | Can be added or modified at any time            |    
| Special Chars  | Limited to alphanumeric characters, '-', '_'     | Allows special characters, larger data          |

- pod/container resources:
    - requests:
        - specify the minimum amount of CPU and memory resources required for a container to run
        - used by the Kubernetes scheduler to determine which node can accommodate the pod
        - ensures that the container has enough resources to function properly
    - limits:
        - specify the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that a container can use
        - prevent a container from consuming excessive resources and impacting other containers on the same node
        - if a container exceeds its resource limits, it may be throttled or terminated by the kubelet
    - it is important to set appropriate resource requests and limits to ensure optimal performance and stability of applications running in Kubernetes

- Config maps:
    - used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs
    - allow separation of configuration from application code, making it easier to manage and update configurations without modifying the application
    - can be created using YAML files or kubectl commands
    - can be consumed by pods as environment variables, command-line arguments, or mounted as files in a volume
    - useful for managing application settings, feature flags, and other configuration data that may change frequently    

- Secrets:
    - used to store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates
    - data is stored in an encoded format (base64) to provide a basic level of obfuscation
    - can be created using YAML files or kubectl commands
    - can be consumed by pods as environment variables or mounted as files in a volume
    - help enhance security by keeping sensitive data separate from application code and configuration

- Services:
They are used to achieve pod communication and load balancing in a Kubernetes cluster and expose applications running on a set of pods. Key points about services:
    - an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them
    - provide stable IP addresses and DNS names for accessing pods, even as the underlying pods are created and destroyed
    - enable load balancing and service discovery within the cluster
    - can be exposed externally to allow access from outside the cluster
    - use selectors to identify the pods that belong to the service based on labels
There are four main types of services in Kubernetes:
    - ClusterIP (default): For internal communication within the cluster
        - exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP
        - accessible only within the cluster
        - used for communication between pods within the cluster
    - NodePort: For external access to the service
        - exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port (the NodePort)
        - accessible from outside the cluster using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>
        - useful for development and testing purposes
    - LoadBalancer: For external access with load balancing
        - provisions an external load balancer (if supported by the cloud provider)
        - exposes the service to the internet using a public IP address
        - routes traffic to the appropriate pods based on load balancing algorithms
    - ExternalName:
        - maps the service to an external DNS name
        - does not create a traditional service with selectors or endpoints
        - useful for integrating with external services outside the cluster    

   
    


#### Errors
- CrashLoopBackOff:
    - indicates that a container in a pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting
    - common causes include application errors, misconfigurations, or resource constraints
    - to troubleshoot, check the container logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>` and inspect the pod description with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
    - ensure that the container image is correct and that all required dependencies are available
    - consider adding readiness and liveness probes to monitor the health of the application within the container
- ImagePullBackOff:
    - indicates that Kubernetes is unable to pull the specified container image from the container registry
    - common causes include incorrect image names, missing tags, or authentication issues with private registries
    - to troubleshoot, check the pod description with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to see detailed error messages related to image pulling
    - verify that the image name and tag are correct and that the container registry is accessible
    - if using a private registry, ensure that the necessary image pull secrets are configured in the pod specification
