#### Kubernetes notes
- namespace:
    - used to create multiple virtual clusters within a single physical cluster
    - useful for separating environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or teams within an organization
    - resources within a namespace are isolated from those in other namespaces
    - default namespace is "default"
    - can create custom namespaces using YAML files or kubectl commands
- pod: 
    - smallest and simplest Kubernetes object
    - represents a single instance of a running process in a cluster
    - can contain one or more containers that share the same network namespace and storage
    - pods are ephemeral and can be created, destroyed, and recreated as needed
    - managed by higher-level controllers like Deployments or StatefulSets for scalability and availability   
- labels:
    - key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects (e.g., pods, services, deployments)
    - used for organizing, selecting, and filtering resources
    - facilitate grouping and managing resources based on specific criteria
    - can be used in conjunction with selectors to perform operations on a subset of resources
    - labels are flexible and can be added or modified at any time without affecting the underlying resources
- Annotations:
    - key-value pairs attached to Kubernetes objects
    - used to store non-identifying metadata that can be used by tools and libraries
    - typically used for configuration or operational information that is not relevant for selection or grouping
    - unlike labels, annotations are not used for selecting or filtering resources
    - can be added or modified at any time without affecting the underlying resources 
    - special characters are allowed in annotation keys and values, making them suitable for storing larger or more complex data   
## Annotations vs labels
| Feature        | Labels                                           | Annotations                                     |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose        | Used for identifying and grouping resources      | Used for storing non-identifying metadata       |
| Selection      | Can be used with selectors to filter resources   | Not used for selection or filtering             |
| Metadata Type  | Key-value pairs                                  | Key-value pairs                                 | 
| Use Cases      | Organizing resources, managing deployments       | Storing configuration or operational information|
| Modification   | Can be added or modified at any time             | Can be added or modified at any time            |    
| Special Chars  | Limited to alphanumeric characters, '-', '_'     | Allows special characters, larger data          |

- pod/container resources:
    - requests:
        - specify the minimum amount of CPU and memory resources required for a container to run
        - used by the Kubernetes scheduler to determine which node can accommodate the pod
        - ensures that the container has enough resources to function properly
    - limits:
        - specify the maximum amount of CPU and memory resources that a container can use
        - prevent a container from consuming excessive resources and impacting other containers on the same node
        - if a container exceeds its resource limits, it may be throttled or terminated by the kubelet
    - it is important to set appropriate resource requests and limits to ensure optimal performance and stability of applications running in Kubernetes

- Config maps:
    - used to store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs
    - allow separation of configuration from application code, making it easier to manage and update configurations without modifying the application
    - can be created using YAML files or kubectl commands
    - can be consumed by pods as environment variables, command-line arguments, or mounted as files in a volume
    - useful for managing application settings, feature flags, and other configuration data that may change frequently    

- Secrets:
    - used to store sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates
    - data is stored in an encoded format (base64) to provide a basic level of obfuscation
    - can be created using YAML files or kubectl commands
    - can be consumed by pods as environment variables or mounted as files in a volume
    - help enhance security by keeping sensitive data separate from application code and configuration

- Services:
They are used to achieve pod communication and load balancing in a Kubernetes cluster and expose applications running on a set of pods. Key points about services:
    - an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy to access them
    - provide stable IP addresses and DNS names for accessing pods, even as the underlying pods are created and destroyed
    - enable load balancing and service discovery within the cluster
    - can be exposed externally to allow access from outside the cluster
    - use selectors to identify the pods that belong to the service based on labels
There are four main types of services in Kubernetes:
    - ClusterIP (default): For internal communication within the cluster
        - exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP
        - accessible only within the cluster
        - used for communication between pods within the cluster
    - NodePort: For external access to the service
        - exposes the service on each node's IP at a static port (the NodePort)
        - accessible from outside the cluster using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>
        - useful for development and testing purposes
    - LoadBalancer: For external access with load balancing
        - provisions an external load balancer (if supported by the cloud provider)
        - exposes the service to the internet using a public IP address
        - routes traffic to the appropriate pods based on load balancing algorithms
    - ExternalName:
        - maps the service to an external DNS name
        - does not create a traditional service with selectors or endpoints
        - useful for integrating with external services outside the cluster    

- Replicasets:
    - ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time
    - monitor the state of pods and create or delete pods as needed to maintain the desired number of replicas
    - provide high availability and fault tolerance for applications by distributing pod replicas across multiple nodes
    - can be created and managed using YAML files or kubectl commands
    - often used in conjunction with Deployments, which provide additional features such as rolling updates and rollbacks

- Deployment:
    - a higher-level abstraction that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to applications
    - allows you to define the desired state of your application, including the number of replicas, container images, and update strategies
    - automatically creates and manages ReplicaSets to ensure that the desired number of pod replicas are running
    - supports rolling updates, allowing you to update your application with zero downtime by gradually replacing old pods with new ones
    - provides rollback capabilities, enabling you to revert to a previous version of your application if needed
    - can be created and managed using YAML files or kubectl commands  

- Volumes:
    - provide persistent storage for pods in a Kubernetes cluster
    - allow data to persist beyond the lifecycle of individual pods, enabling stateful applications
    - can be used to share data between containers within the same pod
    - support various types of storage backends, including local storage, network-attached storage, and cloud-based storage solutions
    - can be defined in pod specifications and mounted into containers at specified paths
    - help ensure data durability and availability for applications running in Kubernetes

    - There are several types of volumes in Kubernetes, including:
        - emptyDir: A temporary directory that is created when a pod is assigned to a node and exists as long as the pod is running. It is useful for sharing data between containers in the same pod. For example , a web server container and a logging container can share log files using an emptyDir volume.
        - hostPath: Mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into the pod. Useful for accessing host resources or sharing data between pods on the same node.
        - persistentVolumeClaim: Uses a PersistentVolumeClaim to request storage from a PersistentVolume
        - configMap: Mounts a ConfigMap as a volume, allowing pods to consume configuration data
        - secret: Mounts a Secret as a volume, enabling pods to access sensitive information securely
        - nfs, awsElasticBlockStore, gcePersistentDisk, and others: Support for various external storage systems        



   
    


#### Errors
- CrashLoopBackOff:
    - indicates that a container in a pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting
    - common causes include application errors, misconfigurations, or resource constraints
    - to troubleshoot, check the container logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>` and inspect the pod description with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
    - ensure that the container image is correct and that all required dependencies are available
    - consider adding readiness and liveness probes to monitor the health of the application within the container
- ImagePullBackOff:
    - indicates that Kubernetes is unable to pull the specified container image from the container registry
    - common causes include incorrect image names, missing tags, or authentication issues with private registries
    - to troubleshoot, check the pod description with `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to see detailed error messages related to image pulling
    - verify that the image name and tag are correct and that the container registry is accessible
    - if using a private registry, ensure that the necessary image pull secrets are configured in the pod specification



## Useful stuff

- liveness and readiness probes:
    - used to monitor the health and availability of containers within a pod
    - liveness probes determine if a container is running and healthy; if the probe fails, the container is restarted
    - readiness probes determine if a container is ready to accept traffic; if the probe fails, the pod is removed from service endpoints
    - can be configured using various methods such as HTTP requests, TCP socket checks, or command execution
    - help improve application reliability and availability by ensuring that only healthy containers receive traffic and that unhealthy containers are automatically recovered
liveness prove vs readiness probe:
| Feature            | Liveness Probe                               | Readiness Probe                                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose            | Checks if the container is alive and healthy | Checks if the container is ready to serve traffic.  |
| Action on Failure  | Restarts the container                       | Removes the pod from service endpoints              |
| Use Case           | Detects and recovers from application crashes| Manages traffic routing based on container readiness|
| Configuration      | Can use HTTP, TCP, or command execution      | Can use HTTP, TCP, or command execution             |
| Impact on Traffic  | No direct impact on traffic routing          | Directly affects traffic routing to the pod         |




- kubectx and kubens:
    - kubectx is a command-line tool that simplifies switching between multiple Kubernetes contexts (clusters)
    - kubens is a command-line tool that simplifies switching between multiple Kubernetes namespaces within a cluster
    - both tools enhance productivity by allowing users to quickly change their working context or namespace without manually editing the kubeconfig file
    - can be installed using package managers like Homebrew or by downloading precompiled binaries from their respective GitHub repositories
    - once installed, users can switch contexts with `kubectx <context-name>` and switch namespaces with `kubens <namespace-name>`


- configmap vs secret:
| Feature        | ConfigMap                                      | Secret                                           |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose        | Stores non-confidential configuration data     | Stores sensitive information                     |
| Data Encoding  | Plain text                                     | Base64 encoded                                  |
| Use Cases      | Application settings, feature flags            | Passwords, API keys, certificates                  |
| Access Methods | Environment variables, volume mounts           | Environment variables, volume mounts             |
| Security       | Not encrypted, suitable for non-sensitive data | Provides basic obfuscation, suitable for sensitive data |   

when config mapchanged, pods or deployments using it need to be restarted to pick up the changes. Secrets behave similarly.
